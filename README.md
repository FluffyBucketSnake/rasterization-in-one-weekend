# Rasterization in one weekend

Inspired by the [Ray-Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and the [3D Programming Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqCJpWy5Fohe8ucwhksiv9hTF5sfid8lA) series.

A software implementation of a 3D rasterization pipeline, written in Rust. Starting from the most basic algorithms, towards more advanced optimizations and techniques.
